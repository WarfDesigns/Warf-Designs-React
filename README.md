<h1>Warf Designs Website Re-Design</h1>

Overview:

A Code: You capstone project utilizing 3rd party API's while also highlighting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript abilities.

Project Overview:

This is a redesign of my current WordPress website. Always preferred a custom built site with my own code; just never got around to actually having the time to do so. This website will show display all my services, have forms for customers to sign contract agreements, forms for appointment schedules, email notifications or sms messages to my phone to notify me, and more. It will also feature a app-like menu at the bottom of the screen for mobile devices, and use javascript to use html templates for the headers, footers, and app-menu to be located on every page of the website.
